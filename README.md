Clash Of Editors
==============

A fun project to compare and contrast [AvalonEdit](http://wiki.sharpdevelop.net/AvalonEdit.ashx) and [ScintillaNet](http://scintillanet.codeplex.com/) editors.

Both AvalonEdit and ScinitllaNet appear to be rich and powerful editors.
There are pros & cons to both and no matter how I look at them, I can't decide who's a clear winner.

This project is basically an attempt to try out different features of the editors to see how they fare against each other (what's easy, what's stable and stuff like that).
